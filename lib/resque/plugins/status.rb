    # Resque::Plugins::Status is a module you're jobs will include.
    # It provides helper methods for updating the status/etc from within an
    # instance as well as class methods for creating and queuing the jobs.
    #
    # All you have to do to get this functionality is include Resque::Plugins::Status
    # and then implement a <tt>perform<tt> method.
    #
    # For example
    #
    #       class ExampleJob
    #         include Resque::Plugins::Status
    #
    #         def perform
    #           num = options['num']
    #           i = 0
    #           while i < num
    #             i += 1
    #             at(i, num)
    #           end
    #           completed("Finished!")
    #         end
    #
    #       end
    #
    # This job would iterate num times updating the status as it goes. At the end
    # we update the status telling anyone listening to this job that its complete.
